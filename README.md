=======

~~This project aimed to bring support of [Google Closure Stylesheets](https://code.google.com/p/closure-stylesheets/) in GWT.~~

**GSS support is now included in [GWT 2.7.0](http://www.gwtproject.org/download.html) and so this repository won't be updated anymore.**

**Please refer to the [official documentation](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideGssVsCss.html)**
